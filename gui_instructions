Requirements for the dynamic form
    node 6.2.1
    npm 3.9.3

Installation steps:

npm install -g create-react-app
npm install -g serve

Use the create-react-app command to create a new app
this could be in any place but better if on the same level as app

create-react-app q_form
q_form could be whatever you want
this creates q_form folder with default app

Inside q_form:
npm install react-form
npm install react-jsonschema-form

Replace the App.js and index.js files with the ones I sent you.

For testing:
npm start

For deploy:
npm run build
serve -s build
